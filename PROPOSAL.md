# IDEAS:

A recreation of the game Civilation 6 with two players. Players will be able to modify board tiles, generate resources and construct units to attack the other player. These civilizations will have tech trees that lead to victory conditions. These include science and domination.

In order to implement multiplayer across different machines, we will have our program read and write files from the public_html directory. 

A recreation of a Fire Emblem game, most likely one from the GBA era. This will also be two-player, each player has the same amount of units. Units have their own classes, chosen by the players before the game starts, that determine their weapons and stat spread.

Recreation of Terraria. This game will allow players to collect resources to build a base and craft items. Enemies will come each night, and the goal will be for the player to survive 10 nights. Enemies will become more difficult as the nights progress.

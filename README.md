# Project Description

This project is a turn-based strategy role-playing game taking inspiration from Fire Emblem, particularly the GBA games. Playable characters have a default weapon, and can be 5 different classes. Lords are all-rounders and a lose condition, Barbarians have good health and attack but have middling stats otherwise, Thiefs have great speed and increased chances to apply conditions but have horrible bulk, Archers can attack from range, and Mages attack with magic but are particularly susceptible to physical attacks. Enemies are only slimes and soldiers. Conditions include sleep, which makes a unit stop moving; bleed, which decreases defense significantly; poison, which hurts the victim each turn for; and pure water boosted, which increases resistance. Each condition lasts for 3 turns, save for the pure water which lasts for 4. The goal is to kill every enemy, however you will lose as soon as your lord dies.

# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface). (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
There will be 5 maps to showcase features like fighting, doubling, and terrain affecting combat, along with one final full map to mimic a standard rout map in regular Fire Emblem. Click on a player to move them and attack or check their stats, conditions, weapons. When implemented, switching between the maps will be done by pressing the number keys.
